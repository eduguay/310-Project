###### By: Sophia Hu, Xuyang Zou, Eric Duguay, and Chris Lam


I'm Hungry is a Web Application made with an HTML, CSS, and Javascript Front-End and a Java Back-End for the CSCI 310 at the University of Southern California.

The application allows for you to search for either a restaurant or food of your choice and provides results. These results are in the form of lists of restaurants and recipes in terms of distances and preparation time respectively. Each of these items can be accessed and details are shown. There is also the ability to add each item to 3 different locally stored lists which allow them to pick their favorites, mark items as **do not show**, or mark items as **try later**.
